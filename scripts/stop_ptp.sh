# This script runs ptp4l and phc2sys on both the master and slave machines. It should be executed
# from the master machine.
#
# The master machine must have passwordless SSH login enabled for the slave to allow remote
# command execution.
#
# To set this up, follow these steps on the master machine:
#             (master)$ ssh-keygen
#             (master)$ ssh-copy-id user@slave
#
# Make sure to update/change configuration variables for both master and slave machines as necessary.
#
# After executing the script, the ptp4l and phc2sys will start synchrnonizing time on both machines.
# The script will wait for the user to press any key before terminating all four processes on both
# primary and secondary machines.


# Determine the directory of the currently executing script
