# This script runs ptp4l and phc2sys on both the primary and secondary machines. It should be executed
# from the primary machine.
#
# Script requires command requires passwordless sudo access on primary and secondary machines.  Follow steps to get that
#   $ sudo visudo
#   Add below line towards the end after @includedir /etc/sudoers.d
#   user_id ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
#
# The primary machine must have passwordless SSH login enabled for the secondary to allow remote
# command execution.
#
# To set this up, follow these steps on the primary machine:
#             (primary)$ ssh-keygen
#             (primary)$ ssh-copy-id user@secondary
#
# Make sure to update/change configuration variables for both primary and secondary machines as necessary.
#
# After executing the script, the ptp4l and phc2sys will start synchrnonizing time on both machines.
# The script will wait for the user to press any key before terminating all four processes on both
# primary and secondary machines.
